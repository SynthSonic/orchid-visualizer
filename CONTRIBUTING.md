# Contributing to Orchid

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Orchid! We welcome contributions from the community and are pleased to have you join us. This document outlines the process for contributing to our project.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct (we expect all contributors to be respectful, inclusive, and professional in all interactions).

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SynthSonic/orchid-visualizer.git
   cd orchid
   ```
3. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-fix-name
   ```

4. Set up your development environment:

   ### üê≥ Docker Setup (Recommended)
   
   We strongly recommend using Docker for development to ensure consistency across environments:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
   
   This will build the Docker image and start the development server. The application will be available at http://localhost:3000. Any code changes will automatically be reflected in real-time.

   ### Alternative: Standard Setup
   
   If you prefer not to use Docker:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Make your changes and ensure they follow our coding standards:
   ```bash
   # If using Docker (recommended):
   docker exec -it orchid-visualizer npm run format:write
   docker exec -it orchid-visualizer npm run lint:fix
   docker exec -it orchid-visualizer npm run typecheck
   
   # If using standard setup:
   npm run format:write  # Format code
   npm run lint:fix      # Fix linting issues
   npm run typecheck     # Check TypeScript
   ```

## Development Process

1. Write your code following our coding standards
2. Add or update tests as needed
3. Update documentation if required
4. Run the full test suite to ensure nothing was broken

## Commit Guidelines

We follow conventional commits for our commit messages. Each commit message should be structured as follows:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types include:
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- refactor: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- test: Adding or modifying tests
- chore: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the documentation with details of any changes to interfaces
3. Ensure all tests pass and code meets our quality standards
4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request to our main branch
5. The PR title should follow the same conventional commit format

Example PR title:
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication support
```

## Pull Request Review

1. At least one maintainer will review your PR
2. We may suggest changes or improvements
3. Once approved, your PR will be merged

## Development Setup Tips

1. Use Cursor or VSCode with our recommended extensions (listed in .vscode/extensions.json)
2. Enable "Format on Save" in your editor for consistent code formatting
3. Install the ESLint and Prettier extensions
4. Docker Development Tips:
   - All changes to the code will automatically be reflected in real-time due to volume mapping
   - Use `docker-compose down` to stop the container
   - Use `docker-compose up --build` when you need to rebuild the container (e.g., after package.json changes)
   - Run commands inside the container with `docker exec -it orchid-visualizer <command>`

## Design Guidelines

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for design guidelines.

## Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features or changing setup requirements
